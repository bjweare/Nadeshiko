#  Thus there needs to be a hook on set -x that will temporarily
#    unset trap_on_debug, and bring it back on set +x.
#  There were special functions debug_on and debug_off, that
#    were intended to use instead of ‘set ±x’, but the habit of using

		#  Salty experience of learning how traps on RETURN work resulted
		#  in the following:
		#  - a trap on RETURN defined in a function persists after that func-
		#    tion quits. That means that one cannot set a trap on RETURN on
		#    entering a function and hope that it will only work once. Even
		#    though without “functrace” shell option set other functions
		#    *will not* inherit it, the source command *will*. In other words,
		#    each time you source an external file and the control returns
		#    back to the main file, the trap on RETURN triggers;
		#  - thus the trap on RETURN has a global scope anyway – and that
		#    means, that it’s possible to remove it from global scope when it
		#    completes what it needs. This way set/unset should come strictly
		#    in pairs – as needed for hiding xtrace diving into bahelite func-
		#    tions;
		#  - in order to be sure, that the return trap is executed and unset
		#    only the level, when it was set, BAHELITE_BRING_XTRACE_BACK
		#    contains the current function nesting level.
