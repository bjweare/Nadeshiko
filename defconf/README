            Nadeshiko default configuration files directory


— What files are here?
— The files, that hold the default parameters with which Nadeshiko scripts work.

— Can I place my overrides here?
— ~/.config/nadeshiko/ would be a better place to hold custom configs.

— Does Nadeshiko always read the files from defconfig? Even if I have my
custom configs?
— Yes.

— Can I just cherrypick the lines from these configs into mine (single) config?
— Yes.

— Are there any rules for naming my config file?
— The format is <SCRIPTNAME>[EXTRA].rc.sh, where <SCRIPTNAME> is the obliga-
tory name of the main script, e.g. “nadeshiko” or “nadeshiko-mpv”, and [EXTRA]
can be any combination of symbols, that are alphanumeric or belong to this set:
