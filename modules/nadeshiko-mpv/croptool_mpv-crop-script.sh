	         #    how ENTER works and how ESC works:
	         #    - by pressing ENTER mpv_crop_script “accepts” the old
	         #      not working crop frame and does nothing. Screen is ready
	         #      to accept the new selection.
	         #    - ESC key however, cancels the cropping with an OK result.
	         #      The user would have to run the whole process over again.
	         #      (That’s actually not as bad as it could be – if Nadeshiko
	         #      wasn’t altering the ESC path in mpv_crop_script.lua,
	         #      pressing it would just stop cropping, leave paused mpv
	         #      fullscreen and a hanging Nadeshiko-mpv process in the
	         #      background – Nadeshiko-mpv would wait for at least some
	         #      result, i.e. croptool_* file to appear in TMPDIR, and it

 # Notes about how it should have been, but could not be implemented.
#
#  Ideally, once the user clicks on “Pick” button to start cropping tool,
#    it would go the following way:
#    - mpv goes fullscreen;
#    - cursor changes its shape into a cross;
#    - Nadeshiko “Cropping” dialog remains in the corner on top of mpv,
#      in the dialog Nadeshiko tells the user expected actions: “Select
#      an area, then press Enter.” The dialog could be moved with mouse,
#      if it would meddle with cropping, but usually it wouldn’t take
#      a big space.
#
#  The troubles:
#
#    Following the specs[1], mpv window in fullscreen is shown on top
#    of all other windows, even those that have  _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE hint
#    set. That means that to have a Nadeshiko-mpv dialog on top of mpv
#    in fullscreen is impossible. However, there are two ways to avoid this:
#
#     - Do not set mpv fullscreen, make it stay a window and place it so
#       it would take the whole desktop.
#
#       Trouble 1
#
#       This will not work in tiling WMs, as there is no common way to untile
#       a window or at least tell, if it’s tiled at all. There are WM-specific
#       window hints, but doing it for every possible WM is a nearly
#       impossible task.
#
#       But tiling WMs should and commonly not tile windows with window type
#       “dialog”! If we temporarily change mpv window type to dialog, the
#       window manager should automatically untile it!
#
#       $ xprop -id $dialog_wid  -f _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE 32a  \
#               -set _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG
#
#       Trouble 2
#
#       This changes a window type, but i3wm seems to make a decision on
#       whether a window should be tiled or floating at the time, when the
#       window is mapped. Changing the type after the window is shown
#       doesn’t make the WM unfloat that window.
#
#       The-en we must somehow tell the WM to redraw, remap or reshow it!
#
#       There is a hint(?) _NET_RESTACK_WINDOW, that is sent to the root
#       window, and it should reapply stacking (i.e. window ordering)
#       for a given window.[2]
#
#       Trouble 3
#
#       _NET_RESTACK_WINDOW takes four arguments. The first one must be “2”,
#       the second is supposedly the window ID, the third one has no descrip-
#       tion and the fourth one shold be zero (or empty?). Xprop manual page
#       doesn’t describe, how one is supposed to pass more than one value
#       to a property. Its -set parameter doesn’t take more than two arguments.
#
#       $ xprop -id $root_wid -f _NET_RESTACK_WINDOW 32cccc \
#               -set _NET_RESTACK_WINDOW  "2  $dialog_wid  0 0"
#
#       – this isn’t working.
#
#
#     - Make Nadeshiko-mpv dialog a child window of mpv!
#       We can successfully change options WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
#       and WM_CLIENT_LEADER for Nadeshiko dialog window.
#
#       $ xprop -id $dialog_wid -f WM_TRANSIENT_FOR 32c  \
#               -set WM_TRANSIENT_FOR $mpv_wid
#
#       $ xprop -id $dialog_wid -f WM_CLIENT_LEADER 32c  \
#               -set WM_CLIENT_LEADER $mpv_wid
#
#       Trouble 4
#
#       It isn’t enough to make a dialog stay above mpv, when it is fullscreen.
#
#
#  The code to retrieve the variables
#
#   root_wid_hex=$(
#   	xwininfo -root -children -all \
#   		| sed -rn 's/.*Root window id: 0x([0-9a-f]+) .*/\1/p'
#   )
#   root_wid=$(( 16#$root_wid_hex ))
#
#   mpv_pid=$(pgrep -f '/usr/bin/mpv')
#   mpv_wid=$(xdotool search --all --pid "$mpv_pid" --onlyvisible)
#
#   dialog_pid=$(pgrep -f python3)
#   dialog_wid=$(xdotool search --all --pid "$dialog_pid" --onlyvisible)
