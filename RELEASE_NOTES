——— v 2.3.9 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.3.9

1. Fixed a couple of minor bugs in bahelite
2. Edited several descriptions in example.nadeshiko.rc.sh




——— v 2.3.8 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-do-postponed-2.2.1

1. Fixed a bug on log file copying, when failed jobs dir wasn’t empty.




——— v 2.3.7 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.3.7

1. Changed defaults for the RC option ffmpeg_subtitle_fallback_style
   in the example.nadeshiko.rc.sh


Nadeshiko-mpv-2.3.3

1. Fixed Tab key not working in dialogues for socket selection and in
   choosing preset / picking size.


Nadeshiko-do-postponed-2.2

1. Added confirmation dialogue at startup.

   This is to avoid accidentally running postponed jobs,
   e.g. when nadeshiko-mpv.sh  and nadeshiko-do-postponed.sh  are bound
   to close hotkeys and these hotkeys may be sometimes confused.

   Now Nadeshiko-do-postponed can be launched freely just to check, if there
   are any jobs. The dialogue will show up only when nadeshiko-do-postponed.sh
   is launched from within an X session (if DISPLAY is set), thus it shouldn’t
   break any cron jobs.




——— v 2.3.6 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Fixed the realpath sourcing in v2.3.5 (still needs dirname).




——— v 2.3.5 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Changed the code sourcing Bahelite to use realpath in all three Nadeshiko
  scripts.




——— v 2.3.4 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.3.4

1. Fixed RC not loading and giving an error on the new bash-4.4.23.
  (Actually a bug in bahelite).
2. Makefile thanks to RX14.
3. Minor fixes related to code style.




——— v 2.3.3 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-mpv-2.3.1

1. Fixed a bug in mpv_ipc.sh – number values in mpv’s cursor-autohide property
   weren’t considered as a valid value.




——— v 2.3.2 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-do-postponed-2.1.3

1. Fixed more bash errors.




——— v 2.3.1 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-do-postponed-2.1.2

1. Fixed bash errors.




——— v 2.3 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Nadeshiko-2.3

1. New command line option: force_scene_complexity

   On the wiki: https://git.io/fxK9I

2. New command line option: dryrun

   On the wiki: https://git.io/fxK9L

3. Bitrate-resolution profile native to the source video is now printed
   to console and log.

4. Fixed a bug, when Nadeshiko couldn’t encode a video, because the built-in
   cover was the default video stream. Now only real video streams
   will be used.



Nadeshiko-mpv-2.3

1. New feature: predictor

   Read the new article on the wiki: https://git.io/fxKyc

2. Preset configuration in nadeshiko-mpv.rc.sh changed: now profiles have
   names for displaying too (sockets already had them). This way config
   file name may stay long (nadeshiko-something-something.rc.sh), and when
   displayed in the Nadehsiko-mpv GUI, it will be just “H.264” or “VP9”.
   Isn’t it cool?

   The tip about setting up with Multiple presets was updated
   on the wiki: https://git.io/fx3Qr

3. New config option: gui_default_preset

   It chooses, which preset should be opened in the GUI by default,
   if there are several presets.

4. New config option: predictor

   Enables or disables the predictor.

5. New config option: run_predictor_only_for_sizes

   Which maximal file sizes the predictor should use (file sizes not mentioned
   in that list will be skipped to save time).

6. Xdialog and kdialog support removed. Hence config option “dialog” was
   removed too. Gtk windows are now the only ones, that will be developed.

   show_name_setting_dialog config option was removed, as it had meaning
   only for “dialog=kdialog” setting.

7. New feature and module: cropping

   Nadeshiko-mpv can now load TheAMM’s mpv_crop_script in runtime, so it is
   possible to crop videos from Nadeshiko-mpv!

   You may have one problem, though: https://git.io/fxKSC

8. Improved socket checks in mpv_ipc.sh

9. Python Gtk dependency bumped to v3.12.

10. GUI: config selection merged with the last window.

11. GUI: damn big redraw.

12. GUI: moved the functions working with xml and python
    into a separate library.

13. GUI: improved generating python code, now based on placeholders,
    pretty unified.

14. GUI: better focus control (first tab activates first element)
    This is not ideal, but the best that could done with Glade
    and Python GObject.

15. GUI: reworked automatic generation of elements in XML and Python.

16. Unified data passing from and to dialogues. Creating a new frontend
    would now be even simpler than with Xdialog/kdialog.

17. Thorough error handling for cropping module: running module’s own
    on_error() to tidy up and moving dryrun logs to LOGDIR. (Normally dry run
    logs are placed in TMPDIR and discarded.)

18. Updated --help output. Now it’s shorter and has links to wiki
    and bug tracker.

19. Preset checks.

20. When Nadeshiko-mpv runs preview and encoded files in mpv, they now use
    now use sound volume of the main mpv. For certain videos previews were
    too loud.

21. Rewinding the video a couple of seconds back on pause is now disabled.
    If you still need it, add in nadeshiko-mpv.rc.sh this line:

    rewind_back_on_leaving_fullscreen=t



Nadeshiko-do-postponed-2.1.1

1. Failed jobs are now moved along with the encoding log files.

2. Logs and job files of failed runs are now placed under
   $HOME/.cache/nadeshiko/postponed_commands_dir/failed/
   (Earlier the logs were placed in
   $HOME/.cache/nadeshiko/logs/postponed_failures/)

3. Groundwork for creating a GUI, aims are:
   - at the start, show how many jobs there is (or show, that there are
     no jobs);
   - do not run the jobs, ask first. This will allow to use the command
     just to see, how many jobs there is;
   - show a progressbar on processing jobs;
   - show a window, when the jobs are complete with statistics, how many
     are encoded well, and how many failed (if any).



Bahelite update

1. Fixed the colours, that were lost in subshells.

2. Fixed silent failures, when local on_error() wasn’t called, because
   subshell return code >0 was passes to || exit $?, and the exit this way
   was considered “clean”. Now errors are processed, backtraces are printed
   to logs and error messages are shown.

3. Added a check for a mountpoint on cleaning TMPDIR.

4. Fixed the code checking for updates on Github. Now only a notification
   will be shown.

5. More characters are allowed in RC file name: . , : ;




——— v 2.2.4 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.2.4

1. Added -nostdin to default ffmpeg options. Update your configs!

2. determine_scene_complexity now uses common ffmpeg option set.




——— v 2.2.3 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-mpv-2.2.2

1. Fixed crash, that happened without postpone.

2. With “postpone” passed via command line gtk GUI will have it force-enabled.



——— v 2.2.2 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Nadeshiko-2.2.2

1. Fixed release notes link.


Nadeshiko-mpv-2.2.1

2. Fixed bug with “postpone” parameter leading to a crash.

3. Fixed potential issue with playing filename not being written to mpv
   data file.

4. Replaced xmlstarlet dependency for binary name (xml → xmlstarlet),
   as apparently, xml symlink is not present everywhere.




——— v 2.2.1 ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.2.1

1. Fixed the bug with encoding entire video, when Time2 wouldn’t get assigned
   as video duration.




——— v 2.2 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Nadeshiko-2.2

1. NEW: ffmpeg_subtitle_fallback_style config option.
   Now you can nicely render SubRip or VTT subs, that have no embedded style.
   Before: https://i.imgur.com/nkdjHgb.jpg
   After: https://i.imgur.com/1DiUAKD.jpg

   What, you do not download Kaguya Luna videos from Youtube? What if she
   marries someone and deletes her videos?

2. Added check for an external encoding function.

3. Removed rudiments of max_size_default being not a link to another variable.


Nadeshiko-mpv-2.2

4. NEW: dialog=gtk config option.
   Better GUI, close to perfect.
   Requirements:
   - python3 with Gtk module 3.0.
   - >=GTK+3.12 in the OS

5. Postponed jobs are now separately put in a new directory,
   “postponed_commands” *file* is deprecated. Jobs now go
   in “postponed_commands_dir”. See also № 9

6. Fixed asking second time for mpv socket.

7. Split dialogues into separate files.

8. Added a check to not run together with Nadeshiko-do-postponed
   (the latter might get wrong log file).


Nadeshiko-do-postponed-2.1

9. Postponed jobs are separated and job files placed into a new directory.
   Old jobs in a single file are still supported and will be processed.

   Now each job is a separate file named after the original video,
   and everything inside is escaped for bash. Having each job in a separate
   file allows for better control:
     a) before, when all jobs were in a single file, this file could be
        cleared only when all of them complete successfully. This could poten-
        tially lead to some jobs being reencoded run after run, if some fifth
        job would turn out unencodable. Now once a job is completed –
        no matter with a good or bad result – its job file is *deleted*,
        but if it completed with a bad result, its log file is copied
        to $LOGDIR/postponed_failures;
     b) this simplifies writing and executing the postponed jobs, there would
        be less possible errors.

10. Added check for simultaneously running processes.




——— v 2.1.3  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-mpv-2.1.1

1. Fixed an error with videos not having any audio track, that prevented these
   files from being encoded.




——— v 2.1.2  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.1.2

1. Fixed bug with custom sizes “tiny”, “small”, “normal”… not applying.

Minor imrovements for Nadeshiko-mpv logging.




——— v 2.1.1  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

1. Keeping an entire config is not necessary any more – it may contain only
   overrides.


Nadeshiko-2.1.1

2. Fixed a bug with one type of SubRip subtitles not being recognised
3. Fixed another bug with external subtitles not being added properly.
4. Fixed overly verbose output for the ffmpeg instance, that does
   subtitle conversion.
5. Fixed a bug when audio track didn’t add, because subtitles were turned off.


Nadeshiko-mpv-2.1

6. Added support for kdialog in parallel to Xdialog. Update the configuration
   file!
   Why the choice didn’t fall upon zenity read the new entry in the wiki:
   https://github.com/deterenkelt/Nadeshiko/wiki/Known-issues-for-Nadeshiko%E2%80%91mpv#----xdialog--kdialog-problems
7. Fixed a bug in preview playback, due to which external subtitles
   weren’t shown on the preview (but still rendered on the encoded video).




——— v 2.1  ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Nadeshiko-2.1

1. Added centering of overlay subtitles which dimensions mismatch
   with video.


Nadeshiko-mpv-2.0.1

2. Since --ff-sid and --ff-aid are found to be broken for E-D releases,
   preview mpv now uses --sid and --aid again.
3. Fixed bug when removed nadeshiko.rc.sh prevented Nadeshiko-mpv from run-
   ning.




——— v 2.0.1  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Nadeshiko-2.0.1

Hotfix for `create_windows_friendly_filenames` config option.




——— v 2.0  ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


1. Configuration, logs and temporary files moved to user’s home directory.
2. RC files format changed, it became more user-friendly with options
   taking “yes” or “no” and bash-specific declarations moved from there
   to their respective scripts.
3. Changed dependency from bhlls.sh to bahelite.sh for bugfixes
   and better error handling, RC files, logs etc.
4. Proper versioning for Nadeshiko, Nadeshiko-mpv and their RC files.
5. Nadeshiko and Nadeshiko-mpv can add a prefix to file name.


Nadeshiko

6. Better FFmpeg compatibility checks – now works with older, stable FFmpeg.
7. WebVTT/SRT, VobSub and PGS subtitles support.
8. External subtitles support for ASS and SRT/WebVTT.
9. Internal check for updates.
10. Encoding modules are taken into separate files, so that
   they served as examples for other codecs (e.g. hardware ones).
11. Time1 and Time2 are now optional parameters.
12. Audio track can be selected. (Before only the default track worked.)
13. max_size_default is now a link to one of the predefined sizes,
    i.e. “normal”, “small”, “tiny” or “unlimited”.
14. Writing metadata to containers.
15. Subtitle and fonts are prepared earlier, so if an error happens on this
    stage, one could notice it faster.
16. Processing of Time and Time2 is reworked and draws closer the time, when
    it would be possible to set multiple time marks and encode a video from
    several fragments.
17. Nadeshiko determines scene complexity.
18. Refactored the code finding optimal bitrate and resolution.
19. Better handling of overshooting.
20. Cleaned work with FFmpeg filters from unnecessary stuff: subtitles and
    fonts processing moved to preparation, this allowed to handle overlaying
    and allow for burning VobSub and PGS.
21. Refactored encoding modules, unified 1 and 2 pass, added more variables.
22. Added more codec-specific variables in the RC file, with descriptions.
23. Added the ability to add custom output options for 1 and 2 passes
    for both libx264 and libvpx-vp9.
24. Can strip “:” and other characters to create Windows-friendly filenames.


Nadeshiko-mpv

25. Menu choosing file sizes uses real values, default value isn’t present,
    added as a mark instead.
26. Can choose presets (nadeshiko.sh configuration files).
27. IPC code moved to separate library.
28. Multiple mpv sockets can be monitored.
29. Better handling of running preview windows with mpv, including the cases,
    when mpv runs in fullscreen.


Bugs fixed

1. VP9 tuning settings are reworked, and now using it provides more or less
   predictable behaviour.
2. Incorrectly passed format for Time1 and Time2 fixed.
3. Fixed several issues with conflicting settings.
4. Fixed wrong `${newarr[total_s]}` due to `$ms` not being converted properly.
5. Nadeshiko-mpv handles errors better, duplicate errors removed.
