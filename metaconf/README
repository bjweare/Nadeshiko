— What are the files here?
— These pieces of configuration contain declarations, that tell *how* the
rest of the configuration options should be read. This includes:

1. All “declare” statements. They lift the burden of specifying them from the
   end users of the application.
2. Generic post-processing like specifying which variables belong to the
   pseudo-boolean type. This allows to keep them as yes/no (on/off, true/false,
   enabled/disabled etc…) in the config, while using simpler notation in the
   main script “[ -v varname ] && …”

— I am a user. Should I be concerned with the config files here?
— No, they are only for the developers.

— I am a developer. Does this folder use the same numbering as in defconf,
or is it separate?
— It’s separate. All metaconf files are loaded before defconf.
